# SocialConnection-between-2-people-in-a-network
In this project, we aim to construct a graph by treating each person as a node and letting an edge between two nodes indicate that the two users are friends. To find the connection between two people or friends, we can define one person as starting node and use breadth first search algorithm to find the shortest path from that starting node to the last node (second friend).
